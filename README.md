If your code editor is capable of parsing JS DOC, the auto-complete feature of your code editor will display the available methods of the SuperDate object, allowing you to easily see what SuperDate adds to the native Date object.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of each functionâ€™s usage, it is recommended to read the JS DOC in the source code. :)
